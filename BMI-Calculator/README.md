# BMI Calculator üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è

**BMI Calculator** is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) application that calculates your **Body Mass Index (BMI)** and categorizes it as **Underweight**, **Normal weight**, **Overweight**, or **Obesity** based on your **weight** and **height**. The app also saves the BMI data to a CSV file and allows you to view trends in BMI over time.

## Features ‚ú®
- **BMI Calculation**: Calculate your BMI based on your weight (kg) and height (ft).
- **BMI Categorization**: Categorizes BMI into **Underweight**, **Normal weight**, **Overweight**, or **Obesity**.
- **Data Storage**: Saves your BMI data to a CSV file for future reference.
- **BMI Trends**: View a plot of BMI trends over time.
- **Graphical Interface**: Built using **Tkinter** for a user-friendly GUI.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è
- **Python** 3.x üêç
- **Tkinter**: For building the GUI üñºÔ∏è.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting BMI trends üìä.
- **CSV**: For saving and loading BMI data üìë.

## Installation üèóÔ∏è

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bmi-calculator.git
    ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory**:

    ```bash
    cd bmi-calculator
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

    Install **Matplotlib** (other dependencies like Tkinter come pre-installed with Python):

    ```bash
    pip install matplotlib
    ```

## How to Run üöÄ

1. Navigate to the project folder where you downloaded or cloned the repository.
2. Run the main Python script to start the BMI Calculator:

    ```bash
    python bmi_calculator.py
    ```

3. The **BMI Calculator GUI** will open.

4. **Input Fields**:
   - **Weight (kg)**: Enter your weight in kilograms (e.g., `70`).
   - **Height (ft)**: Enter your height in feet (e.g., `5.5`).
   - **Age (years)**: Enter your age (e.g., `25`).

5. After entering the values, click the **"Calculate BMI"** button.

6. **Output**: The app will display your calculated BMI and categorize it. Example output:

    ```text
    Your BMI is: 24.22
    Category: Normal weight
    Age: 25 years
    ```

7. To view **BMI trends** over time, click **"Show BMI Trend"**. A plot will appear showing BMI trends based on the stored data.

## Example Usage üéÆ

1. **Input Fields**:
   - **Weight (kg)**: Enter your weight in kilograms (e.g., `70`).
   - **Height (ft)**: Enter your height in feet (e.g., `5.5`).
   - **Age (years)**: Enter your age (e.g., `25`).

2. After entering the values, click on the **"Calculate BMI"** button.

3. **Output**: The app will display your calculated BMI and categorize it. For example:

    ```text
    Your BMI is: 24.22
    Category: Normal weight
    Age: 25 years
    ```

4. The app will automatically save this data to a CSV file named `bmi_data.csv`.

5. To view trends over time, click the **"Show BMI Trend"** button. A plot will be generated showing the trends of BMI values over time.
